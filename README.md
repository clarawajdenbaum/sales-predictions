# Sales Predictions
## Predicting the sales of various objects 

**Clara Wajdenbaum**

### Business problem:

The goal is to make predictions about future sales based on the data provided.

### Data:
Sales predictions

### Methods:

In the feature column 'Item Weight', I have replaced the missing values with the mean weight. I couldn't delete rows with missing values as the percentage was too high.
In the feature column 'Outlet Size', I have replaced the missing values with 'missing'. I have decided to add a new category 'Missing' so it doesn't affect our data.
I have scaled the integer and float columns and I have OneHotEncode the object columns.

### Results:

**Item Outlet Sales via Item Types**
